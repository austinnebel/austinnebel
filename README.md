## Hello! 

My name is Austin Nebel and I'm a Software Engineering graduate from Iowa State University. 

I excel at building full-stack applications using technologies like TypeScript, Next.js, React.js, AWS, and GCP services. I also have extensive experience with Python building backend systems, developing complex embedded Linux devices/servers, and performing data analysis.

Feel free to reach me at any time at nebelaustin@gmail.com.

### Top Repositories

#### Climate Controller

This repository contains a dockerized application that can be deployed on a Raspberry Pi Zero W to control and monitor the climate of a given environment. It includes a Python-based embedded system, a React frontend, and a Django backend that implements HTTP and WebSocket connections to provide real-time updates.

#### Discord Music Streamer

A Discord bot that provides the ability to both search YouTube and play content directly from within Discord. This differs from other popular bots in the following ways:
- Allows the user to search YouTube videos directly from the command interface in Discord
- Will automatically queue related videos, similar to the radio feature on YouTube.
